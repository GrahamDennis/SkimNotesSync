Read Me About Watcher
=====================
1.4

Watcher is a simple demonstration of the FSEvents API.  It monitors a directory hierarchy and keeps track of the total size of the data contained in it.  When a directory inside it changes, it recalculates the size of that directory and updates the total size.

As the FSEvents API is being introduced in Leopard, Watcher requires the Leopard Beta or later.

Packing List
------------
The sample contains the following items:

o Read Me About Watcher.txt -- This file.

o Watcher.xcodeproj -- An Xcode project for the sample.

o Watcher.c -- Source code for the program.

o build -- A directory containing a pre-built version of the program.

Using the Sample
----------------
To use this sample, start by creating a directory to watch (the following assumes you downloaded the sample to the desktop):

$ cd Desktop/Watcher
$ mkdir ToWatch

Then run Watcher against that directory:

$ build/Debug/Watcher ToWatch
Initial total size is: 0 for path: /Users/quinn/Desktop/Watcher/ToWatch

Then, in another Terminal window, copy some files into that directory.

$ cp /mach_kernel ~/Desktop/Watcher/ToWatch/

Watcher will notice the new files and print a line showing the new total size:

New total size: 9052188 (change made to: /Users/quinn/Desktop/Watcher/ToWatch) for path: /Users/quinn/Desktop/Watcher/ToWatch

Watcher supports a number of other command line arguments.  Run Watcher with no arguments to get a short description of them:

$ build/Debug/Watcher 

Usage: build/Debug/Watcher <flags> <path>
[...]

Building the Sample
-------------------
The sample was built using Xcode from the Leopard Beta.  You should be able to just open the project, and choose Build from the Build menu.
